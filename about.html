        Small = Large examines the interconnectedness of nature by exploring how
        small elements can lead to monumental changes, and how even the largest
        forces can break down into smaller parts. Through a combination of
        scientific explanations and thought-provoking imagery, the book offers a
        deeper look into the processes that govern natural growth,
        transformation, and renewal.<br /><br />
        The book is divided into four sections: Seed to Tree, Storm to Drop,
        Pollen to Flower, and Fire to Seed, each highlighting a unique aspect of
        nature’s cycles. These sections showcase the intricate dynamics of
        nature—how a single seed can grow into a massive tree, how a rainstorm
        feeds life drop by drop, how tiny grains of pollen lead to entire
        ecosystems of flowers, and how the destruction of fire lays the
        groundwork for regeneration.<br /><br />
        In addition to its content, the book’s physical structure reinforces its
        themes. Each spread changes in size, with pages growing larger or
        smaller to reflect the shifts between small and large phenomena. This
        design invites readers to engage not only with the ideas presented but
        also with the tactile experience of the book itself.<br /><br />
        This website acts as a digital exploration of the book. With its mix of
        intriguing imagery and insightful text, the digital version of Small =
        Large encourages users to reflect on the power of small changes in

        cycles of renewal.
